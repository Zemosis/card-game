              Khuzur is a card hall you can play in your browser. This page says what we keep about you, why, and how to

                Your browser keeps your sign-in session, your guest name, your saved colors and your sort setting in its
                local storage, so they survive a reload. While you sign in with Google or Discord, our server sets one
                short-lived cookie (ten minutes at most) that only checks the sign-in is really yours.

            <Section title="Who else sees it">
              <p>
                We never sell or share your data. It is stored with the services that run Khuzur: Render hosts the
                website and game server and Supabase hosts the database, both in the United States. Like any web host,
                they may log technical details such as IP addresses to keep the service running. Google and Discord only
                learn that you signed in to Khuzur.
              </p>
              <p>Other players see your name, tag, avatar, level and the results of games you play with them.</p>

              <p>
                We keep your account until you ask us to delete it. To do that, or to see what we hold about you, write
                to <Mail /> from the email on your account. Deleting an account removes your email, password, sign-in
                links and profile; the matches you played stay in the other players' history without your name.
