# Muushig — Rulebook

Muushig is a Mongolian trick-taking card game for **5 players**. Everyone starts
on **15 points**. Winning tricks takes points off your score; the **first player
to reach 0 wins the match**.

In Muushig, winning a trick is called **eating** it (you eat the pile).

The engine in `src/utils/muushig/` implements exactly these rules. If a rule
changes here, change it there and in the in-game rulebook
(`src/components/muushig/MuushigRules.jsx`).

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Players | 5 |
| Deck | 32 cards: 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in all four suits |

A round goes: **deal → go in or fold → swap cards → dealer takes the trump →
5 tricks → scoring**.

## 1. Cards

- Ranks, low to high: **7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A**.
- Suits have **no order**. A card only beats another card of the **same suit**,
  unless it is a **trump**.
- Any **trump** beats any non-trump card. Between trumps, the higher rank wins.

---

## 2. The dealer

- **First round: draw for the deal.** A shuffled deck is set face down in the
  middle. A **random player** draws first, then play goes clockwise. On your
  draw you choose how deep to go, **1 to 10 cards down** (never deeper than the
  pile), and take **only that card**; the cards above it stay on the pile.
  Every drawn card is turned face up.
- The **highest rank deals**. Suits have no order, so **tied players draw
  again** from what's left, in the same order, until one is highest. (If the
  pile can't cover another draw, the tie is settled at random.)
- Every match, rematches included, starts with a new draw.
- **Later rounds:** the deal passes **clockwise** to the next player.

"Left of the dealer" means the next player clockwise.

---

## 3. Dealing and trump

1. The dealer deals **5 cards** to each player (25 cards).
2. The dealer turns the next card **face up** and sets it beside the pile. Its
   suit is **trump** for the whole round.
3. The remaining **6 cards** are the **draw pile**.

The table also has a **dead pile**: every discarded card and every folded hand
goes there face down. Cards in the dead pile never come back this round.

---

## 4. Go in or fold

Starting **left of the dealer** and going clockwise (the dealer decides last),
each player says whether they **go in** this round or **fold**.

- A folded player puts their hand on the dead pile and sits the round out.
  Their **score doesn't change**.
- **At least 2 players must go in.** When the players still to decide are needed
  to reach 2, they can't fold.
- **No 3 folds in a row.** After folding 2 rounds in a row, you **must go in**
  on the next round, whatever your hand. Going in starts the count over; a new
  match starts everyone at 0.

---

## 5. Swapping cards

Starting **left of the dealer** and going clockwise (skipping folded players,
dealer last), each player may:

- **discard** any number of cards (0 to 5) onto the dead pile, and
- **draw** the same number from the draw pile.

You can't discard more cards than the draw pile holds. Once the draw pile is
empty, the players after that can't swap.

### The dealer takes the trump

After everyone has swapped, a dealer who is playing may **discard one card and
take the face-up trump card** into their hand. Unless every card they hold is
better than it, they should. Once it's taken, the trump card is gone from the
table; only its suit remains trump.

---

## 6. Playing tricks

- The **first trick** is led by the first playing player **left of the dealer**.
- Each later trick is led by **whoever ate the previous one**.
- Play goes **clockwise**; everyone who is playing puts down **one card**.

### What you must play

Whoever leads may play **any card**. Everyone after them:

1. **Hold the led suit?** You **must** play it. If you hold one **higher**
   than every card of that suit on the table, you must play a higher one. You
   can't trump in while you hold the led suit, even if someone else already
   has.
2. **None of the led suit, but a trump?** You **must** play a trump. If you
   hold one **higher** than every trump on the table, you must play a higher
   one.
3. **Neither?** Play **any card**.

When trump is led, rule 1 covers it: play a higher trump if you can, else any
trump.

The game only lets you pick cards you may play; the rest of your hand is
dimmed.

### Who eats the pile

The **highest trump** on the table eats the pile. If no trump was played, the
**highest card of the led suit** does. A card of any other suit can never win.

On the table the trick is a **stack**: a card that beats the top card goes on
top, anything weaker is tucked underneath. When everyone has played, **whoever's
card is on top eats the pile**.

---

## 7. Scoring

A round has exactly **5 tricks**. When they're done:

| Piles eaten this round | Score change |
|---|---|
| 0 (and you went in) | **+5** |
| 1 to 5 | **−1 per pile** |
| Folded | no change |

Eating **all 5 piles** **wins the round**: you drop 5, and everyone else who
went in ate nothing, so they each take +5.

## 8. Winning the match

The match ends after the first round in which someone reaches **0 or less**.
The **lowest score** wins; if that's a tie, the player who ate more piles in
that last round wins.
